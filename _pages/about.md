I am a second-year MS student in the Computer Science Department at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). Prior to UCI, I hold a BS degree in Architecture and Urbanism. I also earned an MS degree in Urban Planning from Federal Fluminense University (UFF), advised by [Professor Vinicius Netto](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wGMsjegAAAAJ&hl=en).

My MS thesis (2020) focused on the relationship between urban dynamics and crime. I developed an empirical methodology based on the analysis of network structures that emerge from the relationship between types of crime, victim, and spatial location in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
