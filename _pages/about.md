I am a second-year MSc student in the Computer Science Department at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). Prior to UCI, I earned a BSc degree in Architecture and Urbanism. I also hold an MSc degree in Urban Planning from Federal Fluminense University (UFF), advised by [Professor Vinicius Netto](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wGMsjegAAAAJ&hl=en).

My MSc thesis (2020) focused on the relationship between urban dynamics and crime. I developed an empirical methodology based on the analysis of network structures that emerge from the relationship between types of crime, victim, and spatial location in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

In my free time, I love being in nature--hiking or biking. I also enjoy crafting, especially crochet and embroidery.
