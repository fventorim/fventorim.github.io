I am a PhD student in the [Distributed Systems and Middleware (DSM)](https://ics.uci.edu/~dsm/index.html) group at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by Professor [Nalini Venkatasubramanian](https://nalini.ics.uci.edu/). My research interests include Data Science, Internet of Things, Smart Resilient Communities and Criminology.

Prior to UCI, I earned a BSc degree in Architecture and Urbanism. I also hold an MSc degree in Urban Planning from Federal Fluminense University (UFF), advised by [Professor Vinicius Netto](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wGMsjegAAAAJ&hl=en). My MSc thesis (2020) focused on the relationship between urban dynamics and crime. I developed an empirical methodology based on the analysis of network structures that emerge from the relationship between types of crime, victim, and spatial location in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
