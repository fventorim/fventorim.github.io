We analyzed the urban landscape of the Jesus de Nazareth slum, in the city of *Vitória (ES) – Brazil*, highlighting both **free spaces and urban voids**. We have proposed a revitalization plan for these neighborhood with the goal of creating an urban connection between various underutilized spaces in the area. Our analysis is based on the potential **to repurpose these locations and enhance community coexistence**, leading to increased socio-spatial dynamics within the neighborhood.

To conduct this study, we collected data and conducted site visits to identify the main factors contributing to the presence of these urban voids. Using this information, we devised a solution that focuses on integrating the local community and adapting to their needs and surroundings. Our primary concern was to ensure that the transformation of these spaces aligns with the neighborhood's character and addresses its contemporary challenges, rather than leaving them stagnant.
