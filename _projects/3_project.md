We constructed a **type-morphic framework**, representative of the urban form, through the analysis of streets and their typological variations in the downtown area of *Vitória (ES), Brazil*. This framework characterizes the relationships between physical elements (buildings, lots, and streets) through floor plan analysis and cross-sections, produced with graphical scale.

*Supervisor:* Prof. Agnes Thompson
