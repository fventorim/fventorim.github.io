This project aims to **enhance and transform the resilience of older adults in our communities during disasters** â€“ this population group is often severely impacted during large events due to the lack of effective triage, comfort, and care. Through the use of a smart-space platform called *CareDEX*, this effort will enable the assimilation and exchange of customized care information rapidly between first responders, caregivers in senior housing facilities, and older adults in a secure manner.

*Supervisor:* Prof. Nalini Venkatasubramanian
