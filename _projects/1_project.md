In my master's thesis, we explored relationships between different aspects connecting crime, victims, and spatial locations. We investigated **territorial criminal patterns** in *Rio de Janeiro, Brazil*, to understand how people's spatial location and personal characteristics influence their propensity to become victims of certain types of crime. The hypothesis was that these relationships are not random but involve patterns of connection between certain types of crime, characteristics of victims, and the location of the crime. Heterogeneous connections between these factors would make certain social groups more prone to specific types of crime.

To investigate these connections, we used a method of analysis of **complex networks** capable of grouping (i) similar crime incidents according to the profile of the victims, (ii) the characteristics of the types of crime registered, and (iii) their different locations.The examination of this urban crime topology was carried out in a **large-scale empirical study involving 5,000 randomly selected crime incidents** between 2007 and 2018.
