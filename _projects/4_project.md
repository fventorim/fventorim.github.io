In this project, we analyze the n**atural lighting performance** of four design classrooms at a higher education institution located in *Vitória (ES), Brazil*, to verify the **comfort conditions** experienced by users. This analysis was conducted by comparing the results of in situ measurements of illuminance, following the NBR 15215-4 standard, with perceptions gathered from students, building upon the theoretical groundwork already laid by other researchers.

*Supervisor:* Prof. Aline Silva Sauer
